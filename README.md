# Malware-Analyser-in-Python

We are making use of python and it’s libraries to make a automated malware analysis code, which when given a input of a executable file, will scan it and give the output of what all indicators, flags and common pieces of a malicious code are present in the inputted file.

So to implement this we are making use of ‘pefile’ library, which provides us the function to parse, read and analyze the executable file. Then using various libraries like ‘hashlib’, ‘os’, ‘magic’, ‘math’, ‘subprocess’ and ‘shutil’, we perform the required functions on the file to find what malicious code is present in it.

We also use a rule-set named YARA-rules to find sections of the malicious code. YARA rules are like a piece of programming language, they work by defining a number of variables that contain patterns found in a sample of malware. If some or all of the conditions are met, depending on the rule, then it can be used to successfully identify a piece of malware. So with this we can find sections of code which are malicious and display what issue is it.

We have also made the integration of VirusTotal website’s scanning feature into our application.By using a API key from virus total as a input parameter, the code will also check the inputted exectubale file by using the VirusTotal checker. This will provide a strong additionalconfirmation, combined with our main program, that whether the file is malicious or not.
